### Question 1 :

Find the Single Element in an Array of Duplicates

Given an array of integers, arr, where all numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once, find the number.
Your solution should ideally be O(n) time and use constant extra space.

Example:

Input: arr = [7, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 4, 8, 8]

Output: 7

### Question 2 :

Date : [29/09/2021]

Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

Input: n = 10 Output: 4

### Question 3 :

Date : [29/09/2021]

You are given an integer array nums where the largest integer is unique.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it
is, return the index of the largest element, or return -1 otherwise.

Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1

### Question 4 :

Date : [29/09/2021]

Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of
all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This
also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3

#### Question 5 

Given a mathematical expression with just single digits, plus signs, negative signs, and
brackets, evaluate the expression. Assume the expression is properly formed.


Input: - ( 3 + ( 2 - 1 ) )
Output: -4
